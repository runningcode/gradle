## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 5.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. --> 

## Debug support for forked Java processes

Gradle has now a new DSL element to configure debugging for Java processes.  
 
```groovy
project.javaexec {

  debugOptions {
     enabled = true
     port = 4455
     server = true
     suspend = true
   }
}
```

This configuration appends the following JVM argument to the process: `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=4455` 
 
The `debugOptions` configuration is available for `project.javaExec` and for tasks using the `JavaExec` type, including the `test` task.
 
## Debug tests via the Tooling API
 
In addition to the new DSL element above, the Tooling API is capable of launching tests in debug mode. Clients can  invoke `TestLauncher.debugTestsOn(port)` to launch a test in debug mode. This feature will be used in the upcoming Buildship release.

## Promoted features
