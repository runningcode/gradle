= Viewing and debugging dependencies

Gradle provides sufficient tooling to navigate large dependency graphs and mitigate situations that can lead to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell[dependency hell].
Users can choose to render the full graph of dependencies as well as identify the selection reason and origin for a dependency.
The origin of a dependency can be a declared dependency in the build script or a transitive dependency in graph plus their corresponding configuration.
Gradle offers both capabilities through visual representation via build scans and as command line tooling.

[[sec:debugging-build-scans]]
== Build scans

TODO: more context about build scans

A link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] can visualize dependencies as a navigable, searchable tree.
Additional context information can be rendered by clicking on a specific dependency in the graph.

Every Gradle project provides the task `dependencies` to render the so-called _dependency report_ from the command line.
By default the dependency report renders dependencies for all configurations.
To pair down on the information provide the optional parameter `--configuration`.

[[sec:listing_dependencies]]
== Listing dependencies in a project

A project can declare one or more dependencies.
Gradle can visualize the whole dependency tree for every <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,configuration>> available in the project.

Rendering the dependency tree is particularly useful if you'd like to identify which dependencies have been resolved at runtime.
It also provides you with information about any dependency conflict resolution that occurred in the process and clearly indicates the selected version.
The dependency report always contains declared and transitive dependencies.

Let's say you'd want to create tasks for your project that use the link:https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit library] to execute SCM operations e.g. to model a release process.
You can declare dependencies for any external tooling with the help of a <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations,custom configuration>> so that it doesn't pollute other contexts like the compilation classpath for your production source code.

The dependencies report provides detailed information about the dependencies available in the graph.
Any dependency that could not be resolved is marked with `FAILED` in red color.
Dependencies with the same coordinates that can occur multiple times in the graph are omitted and indicated by an asterisk.
Dependencies that had to undergo conflict resolution render the requested and selected version separated by a right arrow character.

[[sec:identifying_reason_dependency_selection]]
== Identifying which dependency version was selected and why

Large software projects inevitably deal with an increased number of dependencies either through direct or transitive dependencies.
The <<#sec:listing_dependencies,dependencies report>> provides you with the raw list of dependencies but does not explain _why_ they have been selected or _which_ dependency is responsible for pulling them into the graph.

Let's have a look at a concrete example. A project may request two different versions of the same dependency either as direct or transitive dependency.
Gradle applies version conflict resolution to ensure that only one version of the dependency exists in the dependency graph.
In this example the conflicting dependency is represented by `commons-codec:commons-codec`.

The dependency tree in a link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] renders the selection reason (conflict resolution) as well as the origin of a dependency if you click on a dependency and select the "Required By" tab.

.Dependency insight capabilities in a build scan
image::dependency-management-dependency-insight-report-build-scan.png[]

Every Gradle project provides the task `dependencyInsight` to render the so-called  _dependency insight report_ from the command line.
Given a dependency in the dependency graph you can identify the selection reason and track down the origin of the dependency selection. You can think of the dependency insight report as the inverse representation of the dependency report for a given dependency. When executing the task you have to provide the mandatory parameter `--dependency` to specify the coordinates of the dependency under inspection. The parameters `--configuration` and `--singlepath` are optional but help with filtering the output.

=== Example: Using the dependency insight report for a given dependency

.Output of **`gradle -q dependencyInsight --dependency commons-codec --configuration scm`**
----
> gradle -q dependencyInsight --dependency commons-codec --configuration scm

[[sub:solving-capability-conflicts]]
=== Solving capability conflicts

By default, Gradle will automatically choose the component with the highest version of a capability.
This can be useful whenever a component is relocated at different coordinates in a new release.
For example, the ASM library lived at `asm:asm` coordinates until version `3.3.1`, then changed to `org.ow2.asm:asm` since `4.0`.
It is illegal to have both ASM <=3.3.1 and 4.0+ on the classpath, because they provide the same feature, it's just that the component has been relocated.
Because each component has an implicit capability corresponding to its GAV coordinates, we can fix this by having a rule that will declare that the `asm:asm` module provides the `org.ow2.asm:asm` capability:

.Automatic conflict resolution by capability versioning
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=fix_asm]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=fix_asm]"]
====

However, fixing by automatic capability version conflict resolution is not always suitable.
In our logging example, it doesn't matter what version of the logging frameworks we use, we should always select the slf4j bridge.

In this case, we can fix it by using dependency substitution:

.Substitute log4j with slf4j

TODO: BELOW OLD CONTENT TO BE RESHUFFLED

[[sec:version-conflicts]]
== Resolving version conflicts

Gradle resolves version conflicts by picking the highest version of a module. link:https://scans.gradle.com/get-started[Build scans] and the <<#sec:identifying_reason_dependency_selection,dependency insight report>> are immensely helpful in identifying why a specific version was selected. If the resolution result is not satisfying (e.g. the selected version of a module is too high) or it fails (because you configured link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy:failOnVersionConflict()[ResolutionStrategy.failOnVersionConflict()]) you have the following possibilities to fix it.

* Configuring any dependency (transitive or not) as _forced_. This approach is useful if the dependency in conflict is a transitive dependency. See <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:enforcing_dependency_version,Enforcing a particular dependency version>> for examples.
* Configuring dependency resolution to _prefer modules that are part of your build_ (transitive or not). This approach is useful if your build contains custom forks of modules (as part of <<multi_project_builds.adoc#multi_project_builds,multi-project builds>> or as include in <<composite_builds.adoc#,composite builds>>). See link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy:preferProjectModules()[ResolutionStrategy.preferProjectModules()] for more information.
* Using <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:dependency_resolve_rules,dependency resolve rules>> for fine-grained control over the version selected for a particular dependency.

[[sec:locking_dependency_versions]]
== Locking dependency versions

The use of <<declaring_dependency_versions.adoc#sub:declaring_dependency_with_dynamic_version,dynamic dependencies>> in a build is convenient.
The user does not need to know the latest version of a dependency and Gradle automatically uses new versions once they are published.
However, dynamic dependencies make builds non-reproducible, as they can resolve to a different version at a later point in time.
This makes it hard to reproduce old builds when debugging a problem.
It can also disrupt development if a new, but incompatible version is selected.
In the best case the CI build catches the problem and someone needs to investigate.
In the worst case, the problem makes it to production unnoticed.

Gradle offers <<dependency_locking.adoc#,dependency locking>> to solve this problem.
The user can run a build asking to persist the resolved versions for every module dependency.
This file is then checked in and the versions in it are used on all subsequent runs until the lock is updated or removed again.

[[sec:versioning_file_dependencies]]
== Versioning of file dependencies

Legacy projects sometimes prefer to consume <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:file_dependencies,file dependencies>> instead of <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:module_dependencies,module dependencies>>.
File dependencies can point to any file in the filesystem and do not need to adhere a specific naming convention.
It is recommended to clearly express the intention and a concrete version for file dependencies.
File dependencies are not considered by Gradle's <<declaring_repositories.adoc#sec:how-gradle-downloads-deps,version conflict resolution>>.
Therefore, it is extremely important to assign a version to the file name to indicate the distinct set of changes shipped with it.
For example `commons-beanutils-1.3.jar` lets you track the changes of the library by the release notes.

As a result, the dependencies of the project are easier to maintain and organize. It's much easier to uncover potential API incompatibilities by the assigned version.

[[sec:configuration_resolution_constraints]]
== Constraints on configuration resolution

Configurations need to be resolved safely when crossing project boundaries because resolving configurations can have side effects on Gradle's project model. Gradle can usually manage this safe access, but the configuration needs to be accessed in a way that enables Gradle to do so. There are a number of ways a configuration might be resolved unsafely and Gradle will produce a deprecation warning for each unsafe access.

For example:

* A task from one project directly resolves a configuration in another project.
* A task specifies a configuration from another project as an input file collection.
* A build script for a project resolves a configuration in another project during evaluation.
* A configuration is resolved in a user-managed thread (i.e., a thread not managed by Gradle).

If your build has an unsafe access deprecation warning, it needs to be fixed.  It's a symptom of these bad practices and cause strange and indeterminate errors.

More importantly, resolving a configuration from a user-managed thread is not supported.  To ensure that the configuration is resolved safely, it must be resolved in a Gradle-managed thread.  Afterwards, the resolution result can be used in user-managed threads.

In most cases, the deprecation warning can be fixed by defining a configuration in the project where the resolution is occurring and setting it to link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/Configuration.html#extendsFrom-org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration++...++-[extend from] the configuration in the other project.
